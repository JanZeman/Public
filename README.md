# Public
This repository is designed to showcase various templates and patterns. The intention is to expand its content over time.

## Disclamer
The code in this repository is not production-ready and is not intended to be. It is primarily for personal use to stay current with MAUI and other cross-platform and native development technologies.

Unlike some of my other templates (such as Kotlin and Flutter), this one has not yet implemented the Clean Architecture.

Displaying potato varieties might seem quite non-tech, but experimenting with their cultivation is one of my hobbies, so I chose those :)

## Backend
The backend is not a real backend system but a minimalistic simulation. It includes a JSON file with a list of items along with their images.

## MAUI Template 2024

This template aims to simplify the setup of:

- Dependency Injection
- MVVM pattern with automated View-ViewModel mapping
- Extensive use of the Community Toolkit
- Navigation involving the passing of complex objects as parameters
- Organized solution structure
- Enhancing testability
- Mobile-first design
